config file for pipeline: $G/
file transfer script
rename_sync_scr_dirs --> renames the raw data folders automatically
	tack on to the transfer script
adding file transfering and some other preprocessing steps to preprocess.sh
delete intermiediate files from fmriprep

Outline:

from /gpfs/group/mnh5174/default/lab_resources/fmri_processing_scripts/autopreproc/syncMRCTR_Multiband
ls $HOME/.ssh/controlmasters/*WPC-6290* 2>/dev/null 1>/dev/null || ./remote.expect
what does this line do? Seems like it won't work unless the specific user running it has ssh configured in a certain way

in syncMRCTR__MRRaw, those same lines are commented out

renameSLEICSerDirs: shell script that renames the directories of the raw dicom data to something more human readable

in preprocess.sh: converting transferred dicoms into niftis in bids format (heudiconv.sh), fidelity checks, quality checks, and fmriprep
	input and output directories are hardcoded --> make sure to update

Pipeline:

transfer raw data (dicoms) from frmi machines to aci
	/gpfs/group/mnh5174/default/lab_resources/fmri_processing_scripts/autopreproc/autopreproc --> only parts of this command are needed for the new pipeline
		sourcing of config files in /gpfs/group/mnh5174/default/lab_resources/fmri_processing_scripts/autopreproc/cfg_files
			neuromap_cfg? don't have access to it
			syncMRCTR__MRRaw --> transfers raw data from fmri machines to aci. relies on env variables.
rename raw data directories
	renameSLEICSerDirs --> pass it the path to the directory
preprocess (heudiconv, quality and fidelity checks, fmirprep)
