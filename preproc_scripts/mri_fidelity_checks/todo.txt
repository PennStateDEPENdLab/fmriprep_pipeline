* update documentation: passing output dir argument
* test incremental fidelity checks when adding new task
* should detect if there have been changes to the fields. If a header is added to fidelity template, this will make the data in the tsv files useless
* If user does not specify a set of subjects, ask if they want to run it on all, if so, just overwrite the files.
* streamline code
* integrate fidelity checks with other parts of the preprocessing pipeline
* email problems using unix mail system

DONE:
* merge nifti and json tables into one
* T1_w --> he will send me more comphrensive template data
* check accuracy of code
* script to rotate it subject wise --> checks output querying subjects
	incremental - specify range of subject comma sep list
	ID numbers can be non-contiguous
* way to specify specific subject to comapre on: run fidelity checks incrementally on a specific set
	integrate new data from a subset into the existing files
	PANDA data frames in python
		match merging on data sets
* expected vs observed in the fidelity output
* output all errors in a list item
* test new checking format for correctness
	[X] 65 T1w series description is failing the check but does not show in substatus output
* way to specify specific subject to comapre on: run fidelity checks incrementally on a specific set
* commit and consolidate code to gitlab
* create documentation either in code or separate
* bash wrapper script for feeder
